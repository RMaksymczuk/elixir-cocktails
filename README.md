# Elixir Cocktails

## Collection of recipes for mixing delicious web cocktails with Elixir and Phoenix

[Phoenix](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix) and [Ecto](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ecto)
are very much usable libraries already. They
also provide good documentation from the start. Technical documentation
or even [guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/overview) are, however,
often not enough to be productive in newly learned environment.

When I was learning Rails almost a decade ago, I found it very helpful
to see other people's code and solution to basic problems.
[Ryan Bates](https://twitter.com/rbates) and his amazing [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com)
screencasts were great discovery for me, and [Rails
Recipes](https://pragprog.com/book/fr_rr/rails-recipes) by [Chad
Fowler](https://twitter.com/chadfowler) provided a handy reference too.

Today, we have already a lot of good books about Elixir. [Elixir
Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/elixir-cookbook)
and [Elixir in Action](http://www.manning.com/juric/) are two of my most
favorite ones at the moment, as they are focusing on the practical
approach, and provide set of recipes. There is also amazing [Elixir
Sips](http://elixirsips.com/) series of screencats, that I strongly
encourage you to subscrie to.

The problem with traditional books and screencasts alike is that they
go out of date fairly soon. Elixir is still young and fast evolving
language, it's web ecosystem around Phoenix framework is even younger
and more rapidly changing. To keep up with current pace of development,
book authors would have to update their books every month or so.

This book comes out of my need to create a reference for myself, and my
team at [AmberBit](https://www.amberbit.com), where we provide
consulting and web development services in Ruby and Elixir. I hope it will be useful
for you as well.
